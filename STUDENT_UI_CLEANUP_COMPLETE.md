  - Read-only interface (no create/edit/delete)
  - Student-focused language and UI

### API Service Cleanup

  - `updateInterview()` - Students can't edit interviews
  - `scheduleInterview()` - Students can't schedule interviews

### Files Modified

- `/src/components/Layout.tsx` - Updated navigation

### Files Removed/Backed Up
