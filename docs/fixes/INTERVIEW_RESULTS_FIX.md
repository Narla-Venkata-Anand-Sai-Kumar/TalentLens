# Interview Results Page Fix

## Issue Resolved

The URL `http://localhost:3001/interview/16/results` was not working due to several issues:

### 1. Route Structure Fixed

- **Problem**: The route structure `/interview/[id]/results.tsx` was incorrect
- **Solution**: Created proper Next.js dynamic route structure at `/pages/interview/[id]/results.tsx`
- **Result**: URLs like `/interview/16/results` now route correctly

### 2. Import Paths Fixed

- **Problem**: Moving file to deeper directory broke import paths
- **Solution**: Updated all imports from `../../` to `../../../`
- **Result**: All components and utilities now import correctly

### 3. Authentication Fixed

- **Problem**: Multiple API services caused confusion in AuthContext
- **Solution**:
  - Updated AuthContext to use the correct API service from `../utils/api`
  - Removed conflicting API service from `/api` directory (moved to backup)
  - Fixed method calls: `login` → `signin`, `register` → `signup`

### 4. Error Handling Improved

- **Problem**: Generic error handling didn't provide useful feedback
- **Solution**: Added specific error handling for:
  - 404 errors: "Interview not found or you do not have access to it"
  - 401 errors: Redirect to signin page
  - Other errors: Redirect to interviews list

### 5. Student Authentication Setup

- **Problem**: Test student account had no working password
- **Solution**: Set password for `test.student@example.com` to `student123`

## Testing Instructions

### For Interview ID 16 (Access Denied):

1. Visit: `http://localhost:3001/interview/16/results`
2. **Expected**: Redirect to `/interviews` with error message "Interview not found or you do not have access to it"

### For Valid Student Interview:

1. **Sign in first**: Go to `http://localhost:3001/signin`
   - Email: `test.student@example.com`
   - Password: `student123`
2. **Then visit**: `http://localhost:3001/interview/9/results` (or 7, 8)
3. **Expected**: Interview results page loads successfully

### Available Student Interviews:

- Interview ID 7: Technical (completed)
- Interview ID 8: Communication (completed)
- Interview ID 9: Aptitude (completed)

## Files Modified:

- `/pages/interview/[id]/results.tsx` - Fixed imports and error handling
- `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed API service imports and method calls
- `/api/` directory - Moved to backup to avoid conflicts

## Security Notes:

- Students can only access their own interviews
- Attempting to access other interviews returns 404
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to signin
- Proper role-based access control maintained

The interview results page should now work correctly for authenticated students viewing their own interviews.
